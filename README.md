# alcazar-clone
A web based, open-source clone of the (now dead) Alcazar mobile game. This version is forked from https://github.com/tchapeaux/alcazar-clone, which appears to also be abandoned.

# What was the original game?
Not a lot of traces of this game remain. It seems the original developer was not able to maintain it. This is very unfortunate, as it was beloved by many, including us and the original developer of the web version.

Some links:
- [Facebook page of the original developer](https://www.facebook.com/theincrediblecompany), not maintained
- [Original game APK](https://www.apk4fun.com/games/com.theincrediblecompany.alcazar2/#description) to load it on your Android (unfortunately not compatible with Android 11)
- [Dead link to the old website](www.theincrediblecompany.com/try-alcazar)
