# What was the original game?

Not a lot of traces of this game remain. It seems the original developer was not able to maintain it.

This is very unfortunate, as it was one of my favourite!

Some links:

- [Facebook page of the original developer](https://www.facebook.com/theincrediblecompany), not maintained
- [Original game APK](https://www.apk4fun.com/games/com.theincrediblecompany.alcazar2/#description) to load it on your Android
- [Dead link to the old website](www.theincrediblecompany.com/try-alcazar)
